bridgechat-widget
=================

An easy to use Javascript/HTML5 widget that will allow anyone to add WebRTC connectivity to their websites. Very early on in the design stage!

## What is it?

The idea behind the bridgechat project(s) is to create an easy to use video/audio/text chat program using WebRTC.

The project is still in the design stage and is open for any and all suggestions.
